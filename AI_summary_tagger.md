LLM will summarize books and tag them with tags that are appropriate for the book.

Tags to be in the format of the library, ie booru style tags.

Option to merge tags with existing or overwrite existing tags.
OPtion to append or overwrite summary if present.

User can approve or reject the summary and tags. Or allow to auto-approve.

For tagging user can limit the number of tags to a certain number. Prioritize tags based on usage count.
Also prioritize tags based on type. IE genre tags are more important than theme tags. Books should have at least one genre tag.

If the book has tags written in text or in metadata, they should be used as a starting point for the LLM to generate tags. Ie Some books have tags written in the text of the book, or in the metadata.
